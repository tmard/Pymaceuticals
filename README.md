# Pymaceuticals
Application of Matplotlib to real-world situation and dataset.




## Background


Access to a complete dataset from a most recent animal study was provided. In the study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured.


The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens. 




## Methods


The following was generated needed for the technical report of the clinical study:
* Prepare the data
* Generate summary statistics in a DataFrame
* Two bar charts showing the total number of time points for all mice tested, with Pandas and Matplotlib  
* Two pie charts showing the distribution of female versus male mice in the study, with Pandas and Matplotlib 
* Calculate quartiles, find outliers and create a box plot across all four treatment regimens 
* Create a line plot showing tumor volume versus time point for a mouse treated with Capomulin 
* Create a scatter plot showing the tumor volume versus mouse weight for the Capomulin treatment regimen
* Calculate correlation and regression between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment
